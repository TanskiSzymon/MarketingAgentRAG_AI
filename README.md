## 📋 Project Details

![flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec69964-3f5f-444b-98da-baf27484e2a9)

- **Technology:** n8n
- **Integrations:**
  - Google Sheets
  - Google Drive
  - Gmail
  - Replicate API
  - Qdrant (vector database)
  - OpenAI (Embeddings, LLM)

- **Main Features:**
  - Automatic LoRA model training based on user-uploaded images
  - Google Drive photo management
  - Google Sheets order tracking and data management
  - Automatic product content retrieval from PDF (using RAG)
  - Generation of creative, highly customized image prompts
  - Complete automation of the workflow without manual coding

- **Data Source:**
  - The main source of truth is the `Orders` Google Sheet.
  - Each record includes:
    - Order number
    - Payment status
    - Training status
    - Number of generated images
    - Model version info
  - (Note: In production, it is highly recommended to migrate to a real database instead of Google Sheets for better scalability.)

- **Inputs Required:**
  - **10–20 high-quality photos** of the product/object from different angles and with good lighting.
  - **One detailed PDF file** describing the product (use, material, style, color, technical details).
  - Detailed product descriptions significantly improve the quality of generated graphics because the AI agent uses this data to create realistic and striking prompts.

- **Important Notes:**
  - The project uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to analyze the PDF file and extract important content.
  - If the input data is very small, RAG can easily be disabled for faster execution.
  - You are **not limited** to training perfume bottles or cosmetics — **any object** can be trained (e.g., shoes, furniture, tech gadgets).
  - Once the model is trained, it appears in your Replicate account under "Models," and remains accessible for future generations without retraining.

- **Performance and Costs:**
  - **Training cost:** ~2 USD per model (based on Replicate pricing).
  - **Image generation cost:** typically **below 0.10 USD** per image.
  - The workflow is optimized to minimize token usage and API costs.

- **Current Status:**
  - This is an **early (draft) version**.
  - Many improvements and upgrades are planned, including:
    - Better image quality and faster generation
    - Workflow modularization
    - Automated video generation from photos
  - Even in its current form, the system delivers **satisfying and production-ready results**.
